**Terms & Conditions**

By downloading or using the bot, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the bot. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the bot, any part of the bot, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the bot, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the bot into other languages or make derivative versions. The bot itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to The Desktop Team.

The Desktop Team is committed to ensuring that the bot is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the bot or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the bot or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

Dude the bot app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the bot secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Dude the bot won’t work properly or at all.

The bot does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.

You should be aware that there are certain things that The Desktop Team will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the bot will require the bot to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but The Desktop Team cannot take responsibility for the bot not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using the bot outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the bot, or other third-party charges. In using the bot, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the bot outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the bot, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the bot.

Along the same lines, The Desktop Team cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the bot i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, The Desktop Team cannot accept responsibility.

With respect to The Desktop Team’s responsibility for your use of the bot, when you’re using the bot, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. The Desktop Team accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the bot.

At some point, we may wish to update the bot. The bot is currently available on Discord – the requirements for the system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the bot to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the bot. The Desktop Team does not promise that it will always update the bot so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Discord version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the bot, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the bot, and (if needed) delete it from your Discord.
